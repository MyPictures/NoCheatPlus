**Fastbreak:** This check enforces realistic block breaking duration's for survival mode.
|**Config**|**Description**|**Default**|
|**active**|Should players be checked for this behavior.|true|
|**strict**|If set to true, this check will measure the time from interaction to block break. If set to false, it will measure the time from block break to block break, which allows one cheated fast break always, but enforces normal speed for sequences of block breaks, being less strict in laggy environments, or in case the server mod does the interact events differently.|true|
|**intervalsurvival**|Modifier for block breaking in survival mode. Do not set to something higher or all block breaking is likely to become violations.|100|
|**delay**|This is a time in milliseconds that you are always allowed to mine faster than the normal breaking time. This is to account for minimum delays, such as events getting delayed by a server tick. This also means that every block with a lower breaking time can be mined "instantly", still covered by the blockbreak.frequency check, though. Default is somewhere around 100 ms (a tenth of a second), in addition to increasing the grace amount this can be used to deal with more lag. Settings should be tested using the blockbreak.debug or the fastbreak.debug flag to see the difference in timing (Permission nocheatplus.admin.debug - delete stats with /ncp remove <player>).|90|
|**grace**|This is the amount of "time mined too fast" in milliseconds the players may accumulate before triggering a violation. The accumulation keeps track of the last two minutes with a four-seconds-resolution. The default value of 2000 allows you to mine two seconds faster than allowed within 2 minutes, roughly, to account for a little bit of lag. Servers with strong lag spikes might increase this value, or just to be more easy on players with too bad connections.|2000|
